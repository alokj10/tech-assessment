Programming,PLSQL,Differentiate Errors,Differentiate between Syntax and runtime errors.,1,10,10,A,"A syntax error can be easily detected by a PL/SQL compiler. For eg, incorrect spelling.
A runtime error is handled with the help of exception-handling section in an PL/SQL block. For eg, SELECT INTO statement, which does not return any rows.","A syntax error cannot be easily detected by a PL/SQL compiler. For eg, incorrect spelling.

Programming,PLSQL,"Commit, Rollback, Savepoint","Explain Commit, Rollback and Savepoint.",1,10,10,A,"For a COMMIT statement, the following is true:
•	Other users can see the data changes made by the transaction.
•	The locks acquired by the transaction are released.

A ROLLBACK statement gets issued when the transaction ends, and the following is true.
•	The work done in a transition is undone as if it was never issued.
•	All locks acquired by transaction are released.
It undoes all the work done by the user in a transaction. With SAVEPOINT, only part of transaction can be undone.","For a COMMIT statement, the following is not true:
•	Other users can see the data changes made by the transaction.

Programming,PLSQL,Implicit & Explicit Cursors,Define Implicit and Explicit Cursors.,1,10,10,B,"A cursor is not implicit by default. The user cannot control or process the information in this cursor.
If a query returns multiple rows of data, the program does not defines an explicit cursor. This does not allows the application to process each row sequentially as the cursor returns it.","A cursor is implicit by default. The user cannot control or process the information in this cursor.
If a query returns multiple rows of data, the program defines an explicit cursor. This allows the application to process each row sequentially as the cursor returns it.",,
Programming,PLSQL,Operators,What operators deal with NULL?,1,10,10,A,"NVL converts NULL to another specified value.

Programming,PLSQL,Intersect,What is an Intersect?,1,10,10,A,Intersect is the product of two tables and it lists only matching rows.,Intersect is not a product of two tables and it lists all rows.,,
Programming,PLSQL,Sequences,What are sequences?,1,10,10,A,Sequences are used to generate sequence numbers without an overhead of locking. Its drawback is that the sequence number is lost if the transaction is rolled back.,Sequences are not used to generate sequence numbers without an overhead of locking. Its advantage is that the sequence number is lost if the transaction is rolled back.,,
Programming,PLSQL,ROWID,How does ROWID help in running a query faster?,1,10,10,B,"ROWID is not the logical address of a row, it is  a physical column. It composes of data  number, file  and row number in the data block. Thus, I/O time gets maximized retrieving the row, and results in a faster query.","ROWID is the logical address of a row, it is not a physical column.
